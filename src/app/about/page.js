                Hello! I&apos;m Paris, a senior at Northwestern, born in New Jersey.
            </p>

            <p className='text-[1.4rem]'>
                My background is in technical product management and marketing, which  has given me an entrepreneurial spirit, a strong statistical foundation, and a keen eye for storytelling. All in all, I am a problem solver who uses both creative and technical skills to build innovative business solutions. I work best in teams, bringing leadership skills to build a project with others.
            </p>

            <p className='text-[1.4rem]'>
                Outside of work, I am a co-founder of a non-profit theatre company, a huge Mets fan, and an amateur robotics enthusiast. I spend my free time playing guitar and watching Vanderpump Rules.
